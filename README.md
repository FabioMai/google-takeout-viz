# google-takeout-viz
An unofficial visualisation tool to see your Google Takeout data (Youtube Watch History, Google Search history) in an aggregated way!

### How to analyze your own youtube data:
1. Go to your Google account's takeout page: https://takeout.google.com/?hl=en-GB
2. Deselect all data, only select the relevant ones for you (Youtube)
3. Change the format for the Youtube data under "Multiple Formats", change the "History" dropdown from HTML to JSON.
4. Click OK, then click "Next Step"
5. Keep all the settings and click "Create Export"
Once your download is ready, you'll get informed via email. Download your .zip File, extract your data and use your ".json" file in the Takeout Viz.

Any problems? Feel free to open an issue and I'll take a look :)
